/**
 * RTL and generic-CRUD guards, read straight off the source.
 *
 * Rendered-markup assertions are the wrong tool for this. frappe-ui's own
 * `Select.vue` hard-codes `text-left` and `ml-auto`, so a grep over a mounted
 * board's HTML fails on a dependency's internals and says nothing about the code
 * this repo owns. These checks read the files instead: what *we* wrote must
 * express direction logically, and no operational screen may reach a generic
 * Frappe document API.
 *
 * Kept as a spec rather than a lint rule because it is a design invariant with a
 * reason, and the reason belongs next to the assertion.
