/**
 * `2026-08-08` for sending to the server; never locale formatted.

 *
 *     new Date('2026-08-12')        // UTC midnight, by the ECMAScript spec
 *     value.getDate()               // read back in *local* time
 *
 * Those two lines disagree anywhere west of Greenwich. At America/New_York the
 * round trip returns `2026-08-11` — a booking silently moved back a night, an
 * availability window shifted, a calendar opened on the wrong day. Qatar is
 * UTC+3 so it never reproduced on this bench, which is exactly why it survived
 * two builds: 16.7.0 found it, 16.7.1 recorded it, and 16.7.2 owns booking dates
 * so it is fixed here.
 *
 * The rule: a date-only value carries no time and no zone, so converting it
 * through an instant is never correct. It is sliced, not parsed. A `Date` object
 * is a different thing — a real instant the caller built deliberately — and its
 * local parts are read, which is what a caller who constructed local midnight
 * means. `utils/operationalDate.js` applies the same rule for the business date;
 * the two differ only in what they do with nothing (that one falls back to the
 * browser day, this one returns null).
