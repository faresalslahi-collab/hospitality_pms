#:
#: * `cancellation_policy` and `no_show_policy` decide the charge. `cancel()`
#:   requires `CANCEL_OVERRIDE_ROLES` only when there is a charge to waive, so
#:   editing the policy to one that charges nothing waived the fee without ever
#:   meeting the role check that exists to authorise waiving it.
#: * `corporate_account` decides whose credit comes back. Credit is consumed at
#:   confirmation against the account named then; editing the field before
#:   cancelling released credit to an account that never consumed any and left
#:   the original consuming it forever.
#: * `deposit_required` is what `stays._assert_deposit_satisfied` gates check-in
#:   on, so lowering it walked a guest in without the deposit the booking was
#:   sold on.
#:
#: Each has a service that owns it, or none at all - in which case the answer is
#: cancel and rebook, not a silent edit.
