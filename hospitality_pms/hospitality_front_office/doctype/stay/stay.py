#: This is a narrowing, not the fix. The fix is `_guard_created_by_service`
#: below: a status list cannot tell an orchestrated check-in from a hand-built

		reservation is confirmed and due, the room line is not already checked
		in, the guest is not blacklisted, identification is captured, the
		deposit is satisfied, the room is assignable, a Folio is opened, the
		room is marked Occupied and the reservation follows.

		A `frappe.get_doc({...}).insert()` performs none of that, and the sweep
		showed the result: a guest In House with no folio to charge, a room
		still reading Vacant, no Room Status Log entry, availability unaware -
		and the same thing succeeding for a blacklisted guest.

		No arrangement of field values can distinguish that from a real
		check-in, because the difference is not in the values. It is in which
