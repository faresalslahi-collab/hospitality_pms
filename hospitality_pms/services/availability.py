"""Availability: what can actually be sold, per night, per room type.

This is the authoritative availability decision (SAS section 3.5). The frontend
may show an optimistic view, but nothing is ever held or confirmed on the
strength of a client-side calculation.

Nights, not days
----------------
A stay from the 10th to the 12th consumes the nights of the 10th and the 11th.
The departure date is never consumed. Every function here works in nights, and
`nights_between` is the single place that rule is expressed.

What consumes inventory
-----------------------
1. Rooms that are not sellable at all - inactive, out of order, out of service,
   under maintenance, or with a blocking inventory status.
2. Room blocks covering the night - either a specific room, or a quantity of a
   room type (maintenance, group holds, house use).
3. Confirmed and in-house reservations. Reservations arrive in HPMS-0.9.0;
   until then `_sold_by_night` returns nothing and the arithmetic still holds.

Overbooking is added back on top, and only up to the property's configured
limit (SAS section 3.5).
