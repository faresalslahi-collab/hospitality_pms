"""Check-in, stay management and the in-house board.

Check-in is the moment a booking becomes a physical guest in a physical room.
It touches four things that must all move together or not at all: the
reservation status, the room's occupancy, a new Stay record and a new Folio.
Everything here runs inside the caller's transaction so a failure half way
cannot leave a guest checked in with no folio to charge.
