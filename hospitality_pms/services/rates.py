"""Rate resolution: what a room costs on a given night, and whether it may be sold.

The server is the only authority on price (SAD section 5.2). A reservation
stores the resolved breakdown as a snapshot, so re-reading a reservation years
later shows what the guest was actually quoted, not what the rate grid says
today.

Resolution order for one night, most specific first:

1. `Daily Rate` for the exact property / plan / room type / date.
2. The rate plan's own room-type row.
3. The room type's fallback `base_rate`.

Restrictions are gathered from all three levels and the strictest wins - a
date-level stop sell is never softened by a permissive plan-level rule.
