"""Reservation lifecycle, pricing and inventory holding.

The rule this module exists to guarantee: **a reservation may only reach a
holding state if, at that exact moment and under a lock, the inventory is
there.** Everything else here supports that.

Concurrency
-----------
Two agents selling the last room at the same instant must not both succeed.
Confirmation locks the Room Type rows first, then re-reads availability, then
writes. Because the lock is held for the rest of the transaction, the second
agent's read happens after the first agent's write and correctly sees zero.

Snapshots
---------
The rate breakdown is stored on the reservation. Re-pricing a confirmed
reservation from today's rate grid would silently change what the guest owes.

	`Closed` is the one status that is history rather than a live stay - a

	cancelled.

	Read with `lock_and_find`, and called under the Reservation row lock the

# `Reservation._guard_holding_immutability` refuses a document save that would

# the booking holds inventory, and its docstring names what was missing: "a
# service operation ("move/rebook") that does not exist yet". This is that
# operation, and the four editable-state line operations beside it.
#
# These are not an exemption from the guard. Each one re-checks under the lock
# chain first and then writes the guarded columns with `frappe.db.set_value`,
# which runs no validation - the same property `set_line_interval` and
# `_transition` already rely on. The guard keeps standing in front of every
# other route, which is the point: a generic `doc.save()` is still refused.
#
# Nothing here re-prices a booking that holds inventory. `_is_editable` already
# decided that question - past a holding state the guest has been quoted these
# amounts, and re-running today's rate grid would silently change what they
# owe - so where a re-price is legitimate the document is saved and the
# *controller* does it. This module never calls `price_reservation` itself.

#: Statuses in which a booking is still live: it either holds inventory or is
#: on its way to doing so. Deliberately the complement of the controller's
#: TERMINAL_STATES within `TRANSITIONS`, and asserted to be exactly that by
#: `tests/test_reservation_modification.py` - the constant cannot be imported
#: from the controller, which imports this module.
LIVE_STATES = (DRAFT, TENTATIVE, WAITLISTED, CONFIRMED, GUARANTEED, CHECKED_IN)

#: Statuses in which a room line's interval may still be moved.
#:
#: Checked In is absent, and that is the substance of the rule rather than
#: caution: once a guest is in the room the dates belong to their Stay, and
#: `stays.extend_stay` / `stays.shorten_stay` are the operations that move
#: them - they move the Stay *and* this line, together. Moving the line from
#: here would leave the two disagreeing, which is P1-5 from the other side.
INTERVAL_EDITABLE_STATES = (DRAFT, TENTATIVE, WAITLISTED, CONFIRMED, GUARANTEED)

#: Statuses in which a room line may be added, removed, re-typed or re-planned.
#:

#: the operations the controller refuses beyond them - and because each one
#: re-prices, which is only safe while the snapshot is still a working draft.

#: `arrival_date`, `departure_date`, `property` and `guest` are the controller's
#: guarded columns and move only through `change_line_interval`; the totals, the
#: rate snapshot and the deposit are derived; `reservation_status` belongs to
#: `_transition`; and the lifecycle stamps are written by the operations that
#: earn them.

	`min` and `max` against the *new* bounds are what make the disjoint case fall

	where it was, one segment collapses and the other is the whole new interval.

	Nights the move gives up need no check at all. They are released by the write
	itself, and `refresh_header_dates` puts the booking's own span back in step.

	**Do not "improve" this into checking the whole new interval.** Checking the
	difference is not merely cheaper, it is the only form that is *possible* here.
	The added nights are by definition the ones this line does not already hold,
	so its own hold can never be double-counted against it - which is what makes
	the check correct without excluding the line from the availability engine. And
	the engine cannot exclude a line: `_sold_by_night` takes `exclude_reservation`
	and filters on `parent`, so excluding this line would excuse every *other*
	room of the same booking as well, and a three-room booking would be told the
	house had three more rooms than it has. Whole-interval checking would need an
	`exclude_line` that does not exist; the difference needs nothing.
