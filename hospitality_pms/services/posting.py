"""ERPNext financial posting.

This is the boundary between the operational subledger and the system of record.
ERPNext owns the ledger (HPMS-DEC-002); the folio is what the hotel works with
during a stay. Posting turns the second into the first, once.

The contract every function here keeps:

**Idempotent.** Each posting carries a key derived from what it represents, not
from when it ran. For an invoice that is the *set of charge rows being posted*,
fingerprinted - so retrying the same batch reuses the same invoice, while a
charge added later forms a different batch and gets a supplementary invoice of
its own. The key is `unique` on the posting log, so two concurrent attempts
cannot both create a document.

**Faithful.** What ERPNext ends up holding is what the folio says. The invoice's
grand total is checked against the batch before it is submitted, and a payment
that settles a bill says which bill it settles. Neither the tax nor the
allocation is re-derived here: the folio is the guest's bill and posting's job
is to carry it across, not to recompute it and hope the two agree.

**Traceable.** Every attempt writes a Financial Posting Log row,
including failures, with the payload that was sent. A finance user must be able
to answer "what did we send, when, and what came back" without reading code.

**Retryable where safe.** A failed posting stays Failed with its error and can
be retried under the same key. A succeeded posting is never re-sent.

Not solved here: a failure recorded by `_mark_failed` still lives in the
caller's transaction, so a rollback takes the Failed row with it (P1-14). That
needs one durability mechanism chosen across every external side effect and
belongs to the wave that decides it.

# at a time, from whatever snapshot the caller's transaction is holding. That is
# the right shape for reconciliation, which is reading a folio it has just
# loaded anyway.
#
# It is the wrong shape for the Night Audit's close. Close needs a *current*
# answer about a *set* of documents, taken once, immediately before the business
# date moves - and it must not pay a locking round trip per row to get it, which
# is what R1E's reviewers refused. So the set is read in batches grouped by
# DocType, in a deterministic order, and the whole check is over before the date
# advances.
#
# It also needs a stronger question than liveness. A credit note is a Sales
# Invoice with `is_return` set and `return_against` naming the original
# (`sales_and_purchase_return.py:461-464`), with negated quantities, so its
# `grand_total` is negative. Where its receivable lands depends on
# `update_outstanding_for_self`: unset, ERPNext books the GL entry against
# `return_against` (`sales_invoice.py:1673-1676`); set, against the credit note
# itself. And ERPNext *forces* it set whenever the return exceeds what the
# original still owes (`accounts_controller.py:220-223`) - which for a hotel
# folio is the ordinary case, not the exception, because the folio was settled
# at checkout and the invoice's outstanding is already zero.
#
# Either way the original keeps `docstatus == 1` while the money it charged has
# been credited back, and either way the return carries `return_against`. So the
# check keys on `return_against`, which survives the flip, and `docstatus == 1`
