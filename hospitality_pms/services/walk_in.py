"""Walk-in check-in: a guest at the desk with no booking, in one operation.

A walk-in is **not a second check-in engine**. It is the ordinary booking
pipeline compressed into a single call, because the guest is standing at the
desk and the agent has no time to drive four screens:

	existing Guest -> normal Reservation (type and source "Walk In")
	-> ReservationService.confirm() -> StayService.check_in() -> Stay + Folio

Everything that makes a check-in safe already exists and is owned elsewhere.
This module coordinates; it reimplements nothing:

* **Inventory.** `reservations.confirm` locks the Room Type rows, re-reads
  availability under that lock, applies overbooking policy and rate
  restrictions, and drives the state machine. A walk-in never passes
  `allow_overbooking`: selling a room the house does not have is a management
  decision, not a side effect of someone appearing in the lobby.
* **Pricing.** The Reservation controller prices the booking through
  `price_reservation` / `get_rate_breakdown`. A caller-supplied room rate is
  never accepted here, so an agent cannot type a rate into the walk-in form
  and bypass the rate grid (HPMS-DEC-030, server authority).
* **The physical room.** `stays.check_in` owns duplicate-active-stay
  prevention, the blacklist check, the identification requirement, the deposit
  requirement, room readiness and who may override it, Stay creation, Folio
  creation, the room's move to Occupied, the Reservation's move to Checked In
  and the transfer of any deposit onto the folio. It also assigns the room, via
  `reservations.assign_room`, under a row lock on the room.

Why arrival is the business date
--------------------------------
A walk-in arrives "today", but "today" for a property is its business date, not
the server's calendar date. A property that has not yet run Night Audit is
still operating on yesterday's date, and `stays.check_in` refuses an arrival
that is after the business date. Deriving arrival from `nowdate()` would make
walk-ins fail at exactly the hotels that are running late - the ones busiest at
the desk.

Why the whole thing is one savepoint
------------------------------------
Confirmation holds inventory. Check-in is what puts a body in the room. If
confirmation succeeded and check-in then failed - a dirty room, an unpaid
deposit, missing ID - a Confirmed walk-in reservation would be left behind
holding a room for a guest who is still standing in the lobby, invisible to the
arrivals board because nobody expects a walk-in to be pending. Every step here
runs inside one savepoint so a failure anywhere unwinds the whole unit.
