"""Guest Folio: the operational hospitality subledger.

The folio is **not** the general ledger (HPMS-DEC-003). ERPNext remains the
system of record; the folio is what the front desk works with during a stay and
what checkout reconciles against the invoice it raises.

Two properties are non-negotiable here:

**Idempotency.** Every charge and payment carries an idempotency key. A retried
night audit, a replayed gateway callback or a double-clicked button must post
once. `post_charge` and `post_payment` return the existing line unchanged when
the key has been seen (HPMS-DEC-031).

**No silent edits.** A posted charge is never modified or deleted. Corrections
are reversals: a new, negative line that references the original, with a reason
and an actor. That is what makes the folio reconcilable.
