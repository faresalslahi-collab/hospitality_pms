"""16.7.2 — changing a booking after it has been made.

`Reservation._guard_holding_immutability` closed the easy way round every
inventory check: a `frappe.get_doc(...).save()` that moved a departure date out
by three nights, added a room line, or re-typed one, and oversold the house
without a single availability check having run. Its docstring named what was
missing rather than pretending the guard was the answer — "a service operation
('move/rebook') that does not exist yet. Until it does, the only correct path is
cancel and rebook."

This suite is that operation's regression cover, plus the four editable-state
line operations beside it. Four properties are asserted throughout, because each
one is a defect the guard alone does not prevent:

* **Only the added nights are re-checked.** The nights a line already holds are
  the booking's by right, and it is sitting in the very figures a whole-interval
  re-check would read — so extending the last room in the house by one night
  would refuse itself.
* **A confirmed booking is never re-priced.** The guest has been quoted these
  amounts. A date change is not a re-quote, and the deposit split that hangs off
  those line values must come through unmoved.
* **One line's edit touches no other line.** A three-room booking is three rows
  now (P1-6); an edit that reached sideways would silently move a room somebody
  else's guest is sleeping in.
* **Room-type capacity and one specific room are different questions,** and an
  overbooking override answers only the first.

Real data throughout: real properties, real rooms, real rate plans, real roles
expressed as Frappe User Permissions, real check-ins.
