"""The posting-service setup revoked ERPNext's own permissions (16.7.5-R1C).

`setup/posting_service.py` grants the posting identity read on four ERPNext
DocTypes - Sales Invoice, Account, Item and Customer - by inserting a bare
`Custom DocPerm` row for each. Its docstring says this was chosen "so nothing in
ERPNext core is modified and `bench migrate` cannot overwrite it". The first half
is true. The second is the opposite of what happens.

Frappe replaces a DocType's **entire** permission list the moment any Custom
DocPerm exists for it - `frappe/model/meta.py::Meta.set_custom_permissions`:

    def set_custom_permissions(self):
        \"\"\"Reset `permissions` with Custom DocPerm if exists\"\"\"
        ...
        custom_perms = frappe.get_all("Custom DocPerm", ..., filters=dict(parent=self.name))
        if custom_perms:
            self.permissions = [Document(d) for d in custom_perms]

and `frappe/permissions.py::get_all_perms` reads exactly that list. So one
one-permission row does not *add* a grant; it becomes the whole grant set, and
every standard DocPerm on that DocType stops applying to every role.

Measured on this bench before the fix: **122** individual
`(role, permlevel, ptype)` grants destroyed across the four DocTypes. Accounts
Manager and Accounts User lost Sales Invoice and Account outright; Item Manager,
Stock Manager/User, Sales User, Purchase User, Maintenance User and Manufacturing
User lost Item; Sales Master Manager, Sales Manager/User and the Stock roles lost
Customer. Even `All`'s permlevel-1 read on Sales Invoice went.

`install.py` calls `sync_roles()` from **both** `after_install` and
`after_migrate`, so the damage is re-applied by every `bench migrate`.

Frappe's own API does the safe thing, and always did:
`frappe.permissions.add_permission` calls `setup_custom_perms(doctype)` first,
which runs `copy_perms(parent)` to carry the standard rows into Custom DocPerm
**before** the new row joins them.

Two suites here, because they answer different questions:

* `TestCustomDocPermMechanism` proves the mechanism on a purpose-built DocType.
  Deterministic, site-state independent, and it can establish its own premise -
  which a test against Sales Invoice cannot do on a bench where the grants are
  already gone.
* `TestErpPermissionBaseline` asserts the real four DocTypes still carry the
  grants ERPNext shipped, read from the installed `DocPerm` metadata rather than
  from anybody's memory. That is the one that is red on an already-damaged site
  and green once the setup is corrected and the site normalised.
