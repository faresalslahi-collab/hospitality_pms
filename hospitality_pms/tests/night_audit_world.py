"""A property that can actually run a Night Audit, for the Wave-4 suites.

An audit needs more standing behind it than most tests: a property with a
business date, rooms to be occupied, a guest in one of them so there is a room
charge to post, and a posting profile so reconciliation has real ERPNext
documents to read rather than an approximation of them.

Built on the Wave-2 `PostingWorld`, because the reconciliation half of a Night
Audit *is* the Wave-2 ERP reconciliation, and rebuilding a second version of
that setup here would be two chances to configure it differently.
