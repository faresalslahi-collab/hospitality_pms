# mode export), so they reach every bench automatically with the app source.
# Number Card is not a "Document Export" doctype -- developer mode does not
# write it to disk -- so the eight cards the "Hospitality PMS" workspace
# displays would otherwise exist only in the database they were created in.
# Listing them here makes `bench --site x export-fixtures` / `import-fixtures`
# carry them to every other bench the same way the workspace JSON already does.
