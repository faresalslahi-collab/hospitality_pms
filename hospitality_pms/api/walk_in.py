"""Walk-in endpoints for the front desk.

Two endpoints only. The wizard's room and rate lookups reuse the endpoints that
already own them - `availability.search`, `availability.assignable_rooms` and
`reservations.quote` - because a second search that drifts from the first is how
a frontend ends up offering a room the booking path will refuse.

Nothing here decides anything: WalkInService coordinates the reservation and
stay services, and those own the locks, the availability re-check, the pricing
and every arrival guard. Domain errors are deliberately not caught or reshaped -
"a deposit of 500 is required" is the message the agent has to act on, and
flattening it into "walk-in failed" would send them to the wrong screen.
